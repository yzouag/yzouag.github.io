# My Personal Home Page

Hopefully I can make several parts of content in this webpage:

- an about me session, for posting my personal intros and CV and other useful links
- a project tab for listing all projects I made
- a academy summary page, for course reviews and research results
- a tech review page for sharing my thoughts on IT stuff
- a blogging part for sharing my daily thoughts

I know this is quite ambitious, and probably I will not write in English for most of the posts. But wish I can maintain this habit and this will eventually help me a lot throughout my life.
